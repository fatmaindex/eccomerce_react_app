A modern e-commerce application built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**, designed to provide a seamless shopping experience. The app includes features like product browsing, cart management, wishlist, user authentication, and more. It uses **Supabase** as the backend for data storage and authentication, and **Redux Toolkit** with `createAsyncThunk` for state management and async operations.
